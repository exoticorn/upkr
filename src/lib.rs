//! Compression and decompression of the upkr format and variants.
//!
//! Upkr is a compression format initially designed for the MicroW8 fantasy console,
//! with design goals being a competitive compression ratio, reasonable fast
//! decompression, low memory overhead and very small decompression code
//! when handoptimized in assembler. (An optimized DOS execuable decompressor is <140 bytes.)
